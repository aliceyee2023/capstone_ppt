## Introduction

H&M Group is a family of brands and businesses with 53 online markets
and approximately 4,850 stores. Her online store offers shoppers an
extensive selection of products to browse through.

While some customers are good at searching for what they want, others
may prefer not to. Hence, product recommendations become key in
enhancing customer experience.

Simple data, such as garment type and customer age, to text data from
product descriptions, to image data from garment images have been
gathered through the years 2018 to 2021 to study customer transactions.

## Problem Statement

H&M Customers have too many products to browse online. They might not
quickly find what interests them or what they are looking for, and
ultimately, might not make a purchase. To help customers make the right
choices, product recommendations become important.

In this competition, H&M Group invites participants to develop product
recommendations based on data from previous transactions, as well as
from customer and product meta data.
